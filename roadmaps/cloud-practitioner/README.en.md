## 🗓️ **Study Schedule**

In this section, I’ll provide a suggested study schedule.

All sections mentioned refer to the [**Study Material - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 – Stéphane Maarek (Udemy)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new).

In general, each section includes a test at the end. I recommend moving to the next section only if you score above 80%. If you miss any questions, take advantage of the explanations provided on the platform, review the material, consult ChatGPT, a colleague, or search on Google — but **DON’T LET MISTAKES GO UNNOTICED**.

Without a doubt, the course is very helpful, but **avoid just watching slides and listening to explanations**. Be curious — look for product use cases, real-world architectures, imagine how these tools could be applied, build a POC, and try out services in your personal AWS account. More than the badge, **the certification is about gaining knowledge and familiarity with the AWS Cloud**.

Finally, take notes in a text editor or by hand if you prefer. These summaries will be very important, especially when you reach the practice exam stage.
