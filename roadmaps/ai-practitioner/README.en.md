## 📚 About the Exam

Below is a summary of the main information about the exam. These details, along with more comprehensive information, can be found directly in the [**AIF-C01 Exam Guide**](https://d1.awsstatic.com/onedam/marketing-channels/website/aws/en_US/certification/approved/pdfs/docs-ai-practitioner/AWS-Certified-AI-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf).

### What does the exam validate?

The exam validates the candidate’s ability to perform the following tasks:

- Understand the concepts, methods, and strategies of AI, ML, and Generative AI in general and within AWS.

- Understand the appropriate use of AI/ML and Generative AI technologies to ask relevant questions within an organization.

- Identify the right types of AI/ML technologies to apply to specific use cases.

- Use AI, ML, and Generative AI technologies responsibly.

### Recommended prior knowledge

Although AWS certifications do not require a specific order, exams may *assume* a certain level of familiarity with related concepts.

Below is a list provided in AWS’s official documentation for the AI Practitioner certification.

If you feel uncertain about any of these topics, it’s important to review them before taking the exam — even if they initially seem “out of scope.”

- Familiarity with key AWS services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SageMaker) and their primary use cases.

- Understanding of the AWS Shared Responsibility Model regarding security and compliance in the AWS Cloud.

- Familiarity with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to secure and control access to AWS resources.

- Understanding of AWS’s global infrastructure, including Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations.

- Familiarity with AWS service pricing models.

### Content

The exam includes the following content domains and weightings:

- Domain 1: **AI and ML Fundamentals** (20% of scored content)

- Domain 2: **Generative AI Fundamentals** (24% of scored content)

- Domain 3: **Foundation Model Applications** (28% of scored content)

- Domain 4: **Responsible AI Guidelines** (14% of scored content)

## 🧠 General Tips

- 💬 Make **weekly summaries** and use flashcards (e.g., Anki)  
- 📘 Read the **official AWS whitepapers** on AI and ML  
- ⚙️ Explore the **AWS Free Tier** to practice with SageMaker and Bedrock  
- 📅 Maintain a consistent study pace — 1 hour per day is enough  
- 🎯 Focus on **conceptual understanding**, not memorization

## 🗓️ **Study Schedule**

In this section, I’ll provide a suggested study schedule.

All sections mentioned refer to the [**Study Material - AWS Certified AI Practitioner AIF-C01 – Stéphane Maarek (Udemy)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-ai-practitioner-certified/).

In general, each section includes a test at the end. I recommend moving to the next section only if you score above 80%. If you miss any questions, take advantage of the explanations provided on the platform, review the material, consult ChatGPT, a colleague, or search on Google — but **DON’T LET MISTAKES GO UNNOTICED**.

The course is definitely very helpful, but **avoid just watching slides and listening to explanations**. Be curious — look for real-world product use cases and architectures, imagine scenarios where these tools could be applied, build a POC, and try out the services in your personal AWS account. More than the badge, **the certification is about gaining knowledge and familiarity with the AWS Cloud**.

Finally, take notes in a text editor or by hand if you prefer. These summaries will be very important, especially when you reach the practice test stage.

---

### 📆 **Week 4**

- **Day 22**: Take a practice test (Section 13).\
Here’s a personal recommendation:

    - If your score on the practice test is **above 80%**, schedule your exam.
    - If your score is **below 80%**, spend a few days reviewing your notes and the course, then retake the test. Repeat this process until you reach that threshold — it helps ensure greater confidence during the real exam.

> ⚠️ **If you’ve scheduled your exam:** About two weeks before the test, start following this intensive practice routine. Doing multiple mock exams helps you get used to the exam pace and keeps the content fresh in your mind.
